					<h2 class="text-center">About Us</h2>
					<p>This is an idea that generates from the self image of recreating fears which can be summoned on the daily basis of crime we see around. Its been quite a long process to call 100 and people being stoned with thought of informing and be stressed in police administration makes it more trounce. Imagine a scenario of yourself walking in a street and you see there's a group of men or a men which you find as atrocious to a particular movement of time. Calling 100 everytime and making suggestions and describing the same will be a hectic at the sudden moment of time. What do you think we can do next ?</p>
					<p>The Main idea comes into the picture whereby we will be using an application which will be  used as mode of conduct between Police administrations and Users whereby the User will be reporting cases of something suspicious which will be seen by the User which furthur will be sent to Police Administration.</p>
