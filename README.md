# The problem it solves
Imagine, someone is chasing you for a long time. What do you do? Panic is not an option, so you must do something before it's too late, but what? Unfortunately, many people have been in this situation and many were clueless about what to do. So, we bring this portal to you where you can help yourself and others by just sending the query to the police without making a call. But what about the other cases, Why should I use our application then messaging the same to the police, The main idea comes to the mentality of people to not run into many of the police cases and to work up to their own life. So the issue arises how is it different than messaging, the answer comes to the point where there will be a group of individuals reporting something threatening to themselves or the other ones by sending it on our application. The Application uses CNN and different models for structuring the strength cases of a particular area thereby alerting the police and the users nearby. We have also provided different analysis and processing of models available to choose and work up for the police authorities identifying different cases under jurisdiction. For Both the Users as well as Police, we are providing Heatmap for tracking and noting different routes which a user can take for travelling asserting the crime rates in the particular area. For the User security and privacy we tried to include Blockchain as mode of decentralization. For the Market value of the estimated product the Fin Tech idea will be privately to own up big stacks of data and to work up with Different etheurem or any other sdk providing blockchain platform. As per the ideology selling and extending the data and services will always add up to different segmentation in society.

# Challenges we ran into
The Major Issue started with rolling and bundling the Google Maps API which was subjected to charges and we made to look for more and more open source maps, Some of them were MapBox API and React leaflet, By understanding the sequence for including React under the statements, We made our way using React Leaflet. One of the biggest issues we face was of time due to which weren't able to complete a lot of the pending work but we made it as a prototype which may help in future circumstances. The Next big point of changes included rewriting the react leaflet core module as which wasn't included to it and we were stuck hours over this bug to make it work. Coming on the Backend part, we tried over exaggerating some of the request just to see if the api responds in the given time but ended up breaking our NodeJS port and breaking the server for every 3 cases. Furthermore, we faced the issues of checking different elements and their event value during runtime to which we tried for using multiple useEffect but still were unsuccessful. We were quite good with Google OAuth Services and were able to integrate the same with our application which ofcourse right now isn't that scalable, but in future with more time to ascertain will definitely help us make different sets of changes. Furthurmore, it was quite difficult for us to implement blockchain into our application owing to less time we have had got. Adding to this, one of the most time consuming efforts were to analyse the dataset. we extended the same by using Agglomerative Clustering and Multivariate Normal analysis to analyse and create the model. There's particularly need to add more data to the system for better analysis and more significant conclusions.
